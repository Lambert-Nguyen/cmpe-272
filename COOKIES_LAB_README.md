### Routes Added

```php
// Product routes (cookie tracking)
GET  /products/show?id={id}           # Individual product page
GET  /products/recently-visited       # Last 5 visited products
GET  /products/most-visited           # Top 5 most visited products
```

## üç™ Cookie Tracking Mechanism

### 1. Recently Visited Tracking

**Cookie Name:** `recently_visited`

**How it works:**
1. When user visits a product page (`/products/show?id=X`)
2. Product ID is added to the beginning of the array
3. If product was already in the list, it's moved to the front
4. Array is limited to 5 most recent IDs
5. Stored as JSON in cookie for 30 days

**Code Implementation:**
```php
private function trackProductVisit($productId) {
    $recentIds = $this->getRecentlyVisitedIds();
    
    // Remove if already exists (to move to front)
    $recentIds = array_filter($recentIds, function($id) use ($productId) {
        return $id != $productId;
    });
    
    // Add to front
    array_unshift($recentIds, $productId);
    
    // Keep only last 5
    $recentIds = array_slice($recentIds, 0, 5);
    
    // Store in cookie (30 days)
    setcookie('recently_visited', json_encode($recentIds), 
              time() + (30 * 24 * 60 * 60), '/');
}
```

**Cookie Format:**
```json
[3, 1, 7, 10, 2]  // Array of product IDs, most recent first
```

### 2. Visit Count Tracking (Extra Credit)

**Cookie Name:** `visit_counts`

**How it works:**
1. Maintains a counter for each product ID
2. Increments counter every time product is viewed
3. Stored as JSON object mapping product ID to count
4. Used to determine most visited products
5. Stored in cookie for 30 days

**Code Implementation:**
```php
// Track visit count (for most visited feature - Extra Credit)
$visitCounts = isset($_COOKIE['visit_counts']) 
    ? json_decode($_COOKIE['visit_counts'], true) 
    : [];

if (!isset($visitCounts[$productId])) {
    $visitCounts[$productId] = 0;
}
$visitCounts[$productId]++;

// Store in cookie (30 days)
setcookie('visit_counts', json_encode($visitCounts), 
          time() + (30 * 24 * 60 * 60), '/');
```

**Cookie Format:**
```json
{
  "1": 5,   // Product 1 visited 5 times
  "3": 8,   // Product 3 visited 8 times
  "7": 3,   // Product 7 visited 3 times
  "10": 2   // Product 10 visited 2 times
}
```

### 3. Most Visited Algorithm

```php
private function getMostVisitedProducts() {
    $visitCounts = isset($_COOKIE['visit_counts']) 
        ? json_decode($_COOKIE['visit_counts'], true) 
        : [];
    
    if (empty($visitCounts)) {
        return [];
    }
    
    // Sort by visit count descending
    arsort($visitCounts);
    
    // Get top 5
    $top5 = array_slice($visitCounts, 0, 5, true);
    
    $result = [];
    foreach ($top5 as $id => $count) {
        $result[] = ['id' => $id, 'count' => $count];
    }
    
    return $result;
}
```

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Test Scenario 1: Recently Visited Tracking

1. **Start fresh:**
   ```bash
   # Clear cookies or open incognito window
   ```

2. **Visit products page:**
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/company/products
   ```

3. **Click on 5 different products** (e.g., IDs 1, 3, 5, 7, 9)

4. **Check "Recently Visited":**
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/products/recently-visited
   ```
   - Should show products 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 (reverse chronological order)

5. **Visit product 1 again:**
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/products/show?id=1
   ```

6. **Check "Recently Visited" again:**
   - Product 1 should now be first
   - Order should be: 1, 9, 7, 5, 3

7. **Visit 6th product (e.g., ID 2):**
   - Check "Recently Visited"
   - Should show only 5 products: 2, 1, 9, 7, 5
   - Product 3 should be removed (oldest)

### Test Scenario 2: Most Visited Tracking (Extra Credit)

1. **Visit product 1** three times
2. **Visit product 3** five times
3. **Visit product 7** twice
4. **Visit product 2** once
5. **Visit product 10** four times

6. **Check "Most Visited":**
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/products/most-visited
   ```
   - Ranking should be:
     - #1: Product 3 (5 visits)
     - #2: Product 10 (4 visits)
     - #3: Product 1 (3 visits)
     - #4: Product 7 (2 visits)
     - #5: Product 2 (1 visit)

### Test Scenario 3: Cookie Persistence

1. Visit several products
2. Close browser (but don't clear cookies)
3. Reopen browser
4. Go to "Recently Visited" or "Most Visited"
5. Data should still be there (cookies last 30 days)

### Test Scenario 4: Empty States

1. **Clear all cookies**
2. **Visit "Recently Visited":**
   - Should show empty state message
   - "Browse Products" button should appear

3. **Visit "Most Visited":**

## üîç Cookie Details

### Cookie Parameters

```php
setcookie(
    'cookie_name',           // Name
    $value,                  // JSON-encoded data
    time() + (30*24*60*60), // Expires in 30 days
    '/'                      // Path (site-wide)
);
```

### Cookie Sizes

- **recently_visited:** ~50 bytes (array of 5 integers)
- **visit_counts:** ~100-200 bytes (depends on products visited)
- **Total:** < 300 bytes (well under 4KB cookie limit)

### Security Considerations

‚úÖ **Current Implementation:**
- HttpOnly: Not set (cookies accessible via JavaScript)
- Secure: Not set (works on HTTP and HTTPS)
- SameSite: Default (Lax)
- Path: "/" (site-wide access)
- Expiration: 30 days

‚ö†Ô∏è **Production Recommendations:**
```php
setcookie('recently_visited', $value, [
    'expires' => time() + (30 * 24 * 60 * 60),
    'path' => '/',
    'domain' => '',
    'secure' => true,      // HTTPS only
    'httponly' => true,    // Not accessible via JavaScript
    'samesite' => 'Strict' // CSRF protection
]);
```
