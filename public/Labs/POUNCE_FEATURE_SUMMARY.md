# 🐱 Cat Pounce Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented an automated pounce system where the cat attempts to catch the mouse every 5 seconds, featuring multi-phase animations, success/failure detection, and interactive mouse behavior.

## 🎬 Animation Sequence

### Phase 1: Crouch (0.5 seconds)
- Cat crouches down with vertical offset
- Butt wiggle effect (8 oscillations)
- Pupils dilate to 2.0x
- Tail swishing at 5.0x speed
- Mood: 🐱 CROUCHING

### Phase 2: Leap (0.4 seconds)
- Arc-based trajectory toward mouse's position
- Ease-out cubic easing for natural motion
- Travels 40% of distance to target
- Parabolic arc with 60px peak height
- Pupils dilate to maximum (2.2x)
- Tail at maximum speed (6.0x)
- Mood: 🚀 LEAPING

### Phase 3: Landing (0.3 seconds)
- Bounce effect on landing
- Success detection (< 100px from mouse)
- Different reactions based on outcome:
  - **Success**: 🎉 VICTORIOUS mood, pupils 1.5x, tail 3.0x
  - **Failure**: 😿 DISAPPOINTED mood, pupils 0.8x, tail 0.5x
- Large centered message appears

### Phase 4: Cooldown (1.0 second)
- Smooth return to original position
- Message fades out
- Returns to CALM mood
- 30-frame pause before next pounce timer starts

## 🐭 Mouse Behavior

### Panic Response
- Detects when cat is crouching or leaping
- Speed increases to 2.5x normal
- Smooth acceleration/deceleration (10% interpolation)
- Running animation speeds up proportionally

### Visual Indicators
- Sweat drops appear when speed > 1.5x
- Two animated drops with different trajectories
- Drops fall with time-based offset
- Blue tint with 60% opacity

## 📊 Technical Details

### Timing System
```javascript
pounceInterval: 5000 / 15  // 5 seconds at ~60fps (15ms per frame)
                           // = ~333 frames
```

### Success Detection
```javascript
// Checked at 70% through leap phase
const catchDist = distance(catPosition, mousePosition);
catchSuccess = catchDist < 100;  // 100px catch radius
```

### Body Transform
```javascript
// Applied to entire cat body
ctx.translate(catState.bodyOffsetX, catState.bodyOffsetY);
// Affects: body, legs, tail, head, all features
```

### Arc Trajectory Math
```javascript
// Horizontal movement (ease-out cubic)
const easeT = 1 - Math.pow(1 - leapT, 3);
bodyOffsetX = dx * easeT * 0.4;

// Vertical movement (parabolic arc)
bodyOffsetY = 25 + dy * easeT * 0.4 - Math.sin(leapT * Math.PI) * 60;
```

## 🎯 User Interface Elements

### Countdown Timer
- Shows time until next pounce
- Format: "Next pounce in: X.Xs"
- Only visible when not pouncing
- Updates every frame

### Success/Failure Message
- Large 24px bold text
- Centered at (530, 200)
- Color-coded:
  - Success: Green (76, 175, 80)
  - Failure: Gray (158, 158, 158)
- Fades out during cooldown phase

### Mood Indicator
- 8 total moods with unique emojis
- Color-coded for each state
- Updates in real-time
- Top-right corner position

## 🔧 State Machine

```
IDLE → (5s timer) → CROUCH → (0.5s) → LEAP → (0.4s) → 
LANDING → (0.3s) → COOLDOWN → (1.0s) → IDLE
```

### State Transitions
- Timer-based for initial trigger
- Duration-based for phase progression
- Automatic state cleanup on completion
- Cooldown prevents immediate re-trigger

## 📈 Performance Characteristics

- **Frame Rate**: Maintains 60 FPS
- **Calculations per Frame**: ~15 (during pounce)
- **Memory Impact**: Minimal (state object only)
- **No External Dependencies**: Pure Canvas API

## 🎨 Visual Effects

1. **Body Movement**: Smooth translation with easing
2. **Wiggle Effect**: High-frequency oscillation during crouch
3. **Arc Motion**: Natural parabolic trajectory
4. **Bounce Landing**: Damped oscillation
5. **Sweat Drops**: Particle-like falling animation
6. **Fade Effects**: Alpha-based message transitions

## 🐛 Edge Cases Handled

1. **Rapid State Changes**: Cooldown prevents overlap
2. **Mouse Position Changes**: Target locked at crouch start
3. **Success Detection**: Only checked during leap phase
4. **Transform Cleanup**: Proper save/restore context management
5. **Timer Reset**: Prevents drift over long sessions
