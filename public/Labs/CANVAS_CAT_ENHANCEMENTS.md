# Canvas Cat Animation Enhancements

## 🎯 New Features Added

### 1. **Automated Pounce System** ⭐ NEW!
- Cat automatically attempts to catch the mouse every 5 seconds
- Multi-phase animation sequence:
  - **Crouch Phase** (~0.5s): Cat crouches down with butt wiggle
  - **Leap Phase** (~0.4s): Arc-based trajectory toward mouse
  - **Landing Phase** (~0.3s): Bounce landing with success/failure detection
  - **Cooldown Phase** (~1s): Return to normal position
- Success detection based on proximity when landing
- Visual feedback with "🎊 CAUGHT!" or "😿 MISSED!" messages
- Countdown timer shows time until next pounce attempt

### 2. **Mouse Panic Response**
- Mouse detects when cat is pouncing
- Speed increases by 2.5x when being chased
- Smooth acceleration/deceleration
- Visual panic indicators (sweat drops) when running fast
- Running animation speeds up proportionally

### 3. **Eye Tracking System**
- Cat's pupils now track the mouse's position in real-time
- Smooth interpolation for natural eye movement
- Both iris and pupil move together toward the target
- Pupils stay within realistic eye bounds (elliptical constraints)

### 2. **Dynamic Head Rotation**
- Cat's head subtly turns to follow the mouse
- Maximum rotation of ±0.25 radians for realistic movement
- Smooth interpolation prevents jerky motion
- Rotation affects entire head group (ears, eyes, whiskers)

### 5. **Mood System (8 States)**
Based on distance from cat to mouse and pounce animation phase:

**Passive States (distance-based):**
| Mood | Distance | Pupil Size | Tail Speed | Ear Position |
|------|----------|------------|------------|--------------|
| 😺 **Calm** | > 500px | Normal (1.0x) | Slow (1.0x) | Relaxed |
| 👀 **Alert** | 320-500px | Slightly dilated (1.2x) | Medium (1.5x) | Perked up |
| 🎯 **Hunting** | 180-320px | Dilated (1.5x) | Fast (2.2x) | Very alert |
| ⚡ **Pouncing** | < 180px | Very dilated (1.8x) | Rapid (3.5x) | Maximum alert |

**Active States (pounce animation):**
| Mood | Phase | Pupil Size | Tail Speed | Body Position |
|------|-------|------------|------------|---------------|
| 🐱 **Crouching** | Anticipation | Very dilated (2.0x) | Rapid (5.0x) | Crouched, wiggling |
| 🚀 **Leaping** | Mid-air | Maximum (2.2x) | Fastest (6.0x) | Arc trajectory |
| 🎉 **Victorious** | Caught mouse | Dilated (1.5x) | Fast (3.0x) | Bouncing |
| 😿 **Disappointed** | Missed | Constricted (0.8x) | Slow (0.5x) | Settling down |

### 6. **Pupil Dilation**
- Pupils dilate based on hunting instinct and pounce phase
- Larger pupils when mouse is close (hunting mode)
- Maximum dilation during leap phase
- Smooth transitions between states

### 7. **Mood-Based Tail Animation**
- Tail swishing speed increases with excitement level
- Calm: slow, lazy swish (1.0x)
- Pouncing: rapid, agitated swishing (3.5x)
- Crouching: very rapid (5.0x)
- Leaping: maximum speed (6.0x)

### 8. **Ear Perking**
- Ears rotate forward when alert/hunting
- More pronounced when in pouncing mode
- Combined with existing ear twitch animation

### 9. **Visual Indicators**
- **Mood Display**: Top-right corner shows current mood with emoji and color
- **Countdown Timer**: Shows time until next pounce attempt
- **Success/Failure Message**: Large centered text when cat catches or misses
- **Mouse Panic**: Sweat drops appear when mouse is running fast

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Key Functions Added:
- `updateCatTracking(mouseX, mouseY)` - Main tracking logic and pounce timer
- `updatePounceAnimation(mouseX, mouseY)` - Multi-phase pounce animation controller
- `calcPupilOffset(eyeLocalX, eyeLocalY)` - Calculate pupil positions
- Enhanced `eye()` function with tracking and dilation parameters

### State Management:
```javascript
const catState = {
  // Tracking
  headRotation: 0,
  targetHeadRot: 0,
  leftPupilX: 0,
  leftPupilY: 0,
  rightPupilX: 0,
  rightPupilY: 0,
  
  // Mood
  mood: 'calm',
  moodTimer: 0,
  tailSpeed: 1,
  pupilDilation: 1,
  
  // Pounce animation
  pounceTimer: 0,
  pounceInterval: 5000 / 15,  // 5 seconds
  isPouncing: false,
  pouncePhase: 'idle',
  pounceProgress: 0,
  pounceTargetX: 0,
  pounceTargetY: 0,
  bodyOffsetX: 0,
  bodyOffsetY: 0,
  catchSuccess: false,
  catchCooldown: 0
};

const mouse = {
  u: 0,
  baseSpeed: 0.0018,
  amp: 0.0011,
  phase: Math.random()*Math.PI*2,
  panicSpeed: 1.0,        // Speed multiplier
  targetPanicSpeed: 1.0   // Target for smooth interpolation
};
```

## 🎨 Animation Techniques Used

1. **Smooth Interpolation** - Gradual movement using lerp (linear interpolation)
2. **Vector Math** - Calculate angles and distances for tracking
3. **Elliptical Constraints** - Keep pupils within eye bounds
4. **Transform Hierarchies** - Head rotation affects all child elements
5. **State Machines** - Mood transitions based on distance thresholds and animation phases
6. **Easing Functions** - Ease-out cubic for natural leap motion
7. **Arc Trajectories** - Parabolic motion using sine waves for realistic jumping
8. **Multi-Phase Animations** - Sequential animation states with smooth transitions
9. **Collision Detection** - Distance-based success/failure checking
10. **Particle Effects** - Animated sweat drops with falling motion
